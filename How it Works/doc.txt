Node.js Architecture

let's start with the client

-> client request for the server [node.js server]
-> that request firstly stores in the "Event Queue" and,
   
   Request Types
   --------------
   1. Blocking Request
   2. Non-Blocking Request

-> if the request is blocking it reaches to "Thread Pool"
-> Else it is instantly handled by the "Event Loop" .

-> In thread pool each request is provided with 1 thread and after completion of task it seatle back in the
   Thread pool.
   The default size of the thread pool is 4 and can be extended up to 8. [depends]
   To know the Thread of our Laptop
   >> const os = require("os");
   >> console.log(os.cpus().length) 
   .... 8

The os is a module that retrives the system data.
