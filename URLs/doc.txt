https:// -->> "Protocol" which is a set of rules that the browser communicates with the server.

 ------------------------> QUERY PARAMETERS <------------------------------------
 It is the extra info. in the url which comes after the Question mark.

 eg: https://google.com/about?userId=1&a=2
     https://youtube.com/search?search_query=Animal+songs+

hmm, Now the http package cannot find what were the queries and the path[URL resolution and parsing aren't possible].
So, we install external module called "url", using "npm i url".   

Afterthat, you can find the dependencies section in the package.json file consists the "url" object with the installed 
version.

Parsed URL objects have some or all of the following fields, depending on whether or not they exist in the URL string. Any parts that are not in the URL string will not be in the parsed object. Examples are shown for the URL

'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'

href: The full URL that was originally parsed. Both the protocol and host are lowercased.

Example: 'http://user:pass@host.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash'

protocol: The request protocol, lowercased.

Example: 'http:'

host: The full lowercased host portion of the URL, including port information.

Example: 'host.com:8080'

auth: The authentication information portion of a URL.

Example: 'user:pass'

hostname: Just the lowercased hostname portion of the host.

Example: 'host.com'

port: The port number portion of the host.

Example: '8080'

pathname: The path section of the URL, that comes after the host and before the query, including the initial slash if present.

Example: '/p/a/t/h'

search: The 'query string' portion of the URL, including the leading question mark.

Example: '?query=string'

path: Concatenation of pathname and search.

Example: '/p/a/t/h?query=string'

query: Either the 'params' portion of the query string, or a querystring-parsed object.

Example: 'query=string' or {'query':'string'}

hash: The 'fragment' portion of the URL including the pound-sign.

Example: '#hash'
