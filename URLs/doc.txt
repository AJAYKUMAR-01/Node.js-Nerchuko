https:// -->> "Protocol" which is a set of rules that the browser communicates with the server.

google.com -->> "domain name" as we can't remember the IP address.

                to know the IP add., Just Give "ping <domain_name>" in the cmd.

/  -->> "Path"
/contacts --->> "path"
/about -->> "path"

/about/1 --->> "Nested path"

 -------> QUERY PARAMETERS <---------
 It is the extra info. in the url which comes after the Question mark.

 eg: https://google.com/about?userId=1&a=2
     https://youtube.com/search?search_query=Animal+songs+

hmm, Now the http package cannot find what were the queries and the path[URL resolution and parsing aren't possible].
So, we install external module called "url", using "npm i url".   

Afterthat, you can find the dependencies section in the package.json file consists the "url" object with the installed 
version.
